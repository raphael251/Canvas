# HTML <canvas> tutorials from [Chris Courses's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA) on Youtube

I created this repository to store my learning in canvas and js tutorials.

I recommend that you visit the channel link above if you want to learn some javascript coding and about the canvas HTML element and how to create animations and graphics. 

If you want to see my canvas working, just clone this repository and open the .html files.
